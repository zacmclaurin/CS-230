# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

# Draw It or Lose It is a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms. The purpose of this game is to have multiple teams consisting of several people complete four rounds at a minute each. When a picture is rendered from a library of images one team guesses what they think the images is. If they do not guess correctly before time expires then the remaining teams have an opportunity to guess what they think the image is. 

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

# I believe that I did really well at pointing out the design constraints.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

# I found it helpful to know what I needed the program to do and the constraints it had all on one document. 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

# I would like to be able to revise the security section. I would be able to improve this section by having more knowledge about security and different ways to implement it. 

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

# I tried to design the software strictly around what the user wanted. This is important because if the user isn't happy with the product then other people are likely to not use the product. 

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

#  I just took designing the software step by step. Only doing what was required for me to do that week. This helped so that I was only focused on that one section and not worrying about what I would have to do later on.
